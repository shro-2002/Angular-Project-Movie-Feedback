# Movie Feedback App - Angular

This is a simple Angular application that allows users to provide feedback for movies. The app does not have a backend and stores the feedback data locally. It serves as a demonstration of various Angular concepts and features.

## Features

- **User Feedback**: Users can provide feedback for movies, including ratings and comments.
- **List of Movies**: The app displays a list of movies for users to choose from.
- **Data Binding**: Utilizes two-way data binding for user feedback inputs.
- **Angular Services**: Demonstrates the use of services to manage data and communication.
- **Routing**: Uses Angular routing to navigate between different components.
- **Form Handling**: Shows how to handle forms and form validation.
- **Local Storage**: Feedback data is stored in the browser's local storage.
- **Component Interaction**: Illustrates parent-child component communication.
- **Angular CLI**: Developed using the Angular CLI for a structured project setup.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-feedback-app.git
   cd movie-feedback-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to access the Movie Feedback App.

3. Select a movie from the list, provide your feedback, and submit it. The feedback data will be stored locally.

## Folder Structure

The project structure follows Angular's conventions:

- `src/app`: Contains the application's components, services, and modules.
- `src/assets`: Store static assets such as images.
- `src/environments`: Environment-specific configuration.

## Known Issues

- This app does not have user authentication or a backend, so the feedback data is stored only on the client side. Data is lost when the browser cache is cleared.
